  "content": "Cats scratch furniture for a variety of reasons, including marking their territory, stretching their muscles, and sharpening their claws. To get your cat to stop scratching furniture, provide them with a scratching post or pad, trim their claws regularly, and use deterrents like double-sided tape or citrus spray. You can also try covering the furniture with a blanket or plastic cover to protect it from scratches. If your cat continues to scratch furniture, consult with your veterinarian or a professional cat behaviorist for additional advice."
